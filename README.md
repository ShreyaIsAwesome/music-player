This is a simple music player app with three different songs. I wanted to make it a "beachy" vibe that matched the different times of day, hence the change in style/images for each song. I utilized React, a JS library, to create this interactivity within my website. This was my first time using React so it was definitely a learning curve but it certainly was a lot of fun playing around with it!
